## Assignment 2

My first game.

Shoot the targets before they reach the centre of the screen. When a target is hit it will explode. The explosion causes other nearby targets to explode. You can use this mechanic to cause chain reactions. When a target reaches the centre, your player gets bigger and nukes all targets on screen. The game ends when the player is too big to fit on the screen.
