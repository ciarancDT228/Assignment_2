## Assignment 2

My first game.

Shoot the targets before they reach the centre of the screen. When a target is hit it will explode. The explosion causes other nearby targets to explode. You can use this mechanic to cause chain reactions. When a target reaches the centre, your player gets bigger and nukes all targets on screen. The game ends when the player is too big to fit on the screen.

Everything is procedurally drawn. No sprites were used and all the code is my own.

Note: While I was committing from home I was logged in as a different github user (CiaranCarroll88 instead of ciarancDT228). So if you click on the repo you'll see I have ~40 commits even though my "public contributions" are almost non-existent.
